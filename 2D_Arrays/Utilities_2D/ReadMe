How to link two files in C++

A : How to use methods of one .cpp file to another .cpp file

    1. Create a "transferFrom.cpp" and "transferFrom.h"     in our case ( Utils.h and Utils.cpp)
    2. Define the methods in the "transferFrom.cpp" clearly.
    3. Declare all the methods in ""transferFrom.cpp"" file  inside "transferFrom.h" file

B : Use and Compile

    1. Create a file "transferTo.cpp" in which you want to use the methods from tranferFrom.cpp File
     in our case (BasicFunction.cpp).

    2. Compile the file as "g++ transferFrom.cpp  transferTo.cpp"
    3. To run the files : ".\a.exe"

Reason to manually compile : That is how the files are compiled in c++ but since i was using codeRunner to run the file it was ez. Now the code runner won't identify the file.

Code Runner runs and compiles the code.
